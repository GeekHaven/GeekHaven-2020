# NOTE: there may still be some issues, I have patched or at least tried to patch the issues that I found

# the issue here is that after the 'header(...)' call in the PHP files,
# the user is redirected to the provided url but the rest of the page is still processed/rendered
# so the user gets the response with the data that they shouldn't get but they are presented the later (redirected) page
# the earlier processed response is also received but appended to the HTTP History - can easily be checked using BurpSuite (for example)

# there are other issues as well other than this 'header(...)' vulnerability
# I will inform accordingly

## following are the files that I have checked and fixed the 'header' function vulnerability
## egrep -i 'header *\(' `find . -type f | egrep -i '*.php'` 2>/dev/null | awk -F: '{print $1}' | uniq > vulnerable_files.log
## code `cat vulnerable_files.log`
